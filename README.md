# Spigot Tutorials

Hi all,

Hope you have enjoyed my videos and are coming for some code!

Be aware that these are Maven Projects (Still written in Java) not Java Projects, but you can still take the code from them.
I use Maven as it simplifies my workflow but it may not be as easy for beginners to use.

Please let me know if you have a problem.
